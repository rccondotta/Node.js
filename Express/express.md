# First Express.js API

## Why Express

Express.js is a popular and widely used web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple, yet powerful set of features for building web applications and APIs, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to create web applications using Node.js.

Here are some of the reasons why developers use Express.js in Node.js:

Routing: Express.js provides a powerful routing mechanism that makes it easy to define routes for handling HTTP requests.

Middleware: Express.js supports middleware functions that can be used to perform common tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

Modular design: Express.js follows a modular design, making it easy to add third-party middleware and plugins to extend its functionality.

Template engine: Express.js supports popular template engines like EJS and Handlebars, making it easy to generate HTML dynamically.

Community: Express.js has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support through forums, blogs, and social media.

Overall, Express.js simplifies the development process and allows developers to build robust and scalable web applications quickly and easily using Node.js.

## Express vs Next.js vs Koa

Express.js, Next.js, and Koa are all popular web application frameworks for Node.js, but they differ in their approach and intended use cases. Here's a brief comparison:

Express.js: Express.js is a minimalist and flexible framework that provides a basic set of tools for building web applications and APIs. It's popular for its simplicity, ease of use, and extensive middleware support. Express.js is a good choice for developers who want full control over the application architecture and don't need advanced features like server-side rendering or automatic code splitting.

Next.js: Next.js is a framework built on top of React that provides server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and other advanced features for building high-performance web applications. It's designed to make it easy to build complex applications with minimal setup and configuration. Next.js is a good choice for developers who want to build high-performance web applications with server-side rendering and SEO optimization without having to configure complex build pipelines.

Koa: Koa is a lightweight and modular framework that provides a set of building blocks for building web applications and APIs. It's popular for its simple and elegant API, support for async/await, and middleware composition. Koa is a good choice for developers who want a lightweight framework that provides a solid foundation for building scalable and modular web applications.

In summary, Express.js is a flexible and minimalist framework that provides a basic set of tools for building web applications, Next.js is a framework built on top of React that provides advanced features like server-side rendering, and Koa is a lightweight and modular framework that provides a solid foundation for building scalable and modular web applications. The choice of framework ultimately depends on the specific needs and requirements of the project.

## Route Paramaters

Route parameters are a feature of web application frameworks that allow developers to define dynamic segments in the URL of a web page. In Node.js with Express.js, route parameters are defined by placing a colon (:) before a segment of the URL. For example, consider the following Express.js route:

```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // ...
});
```
In this route, the segment ":id" is a route parameter that matches any string in the URL segment that follows "/users/". When a request is made to this route, the parameter value is captured and stored in the req.params object. In this case, the id parameter can be accessed using req.params.id.

Route parameters are useful for building web applications with dynamic content, such as displaying user profiles, blog posts, or product pages. They allow developers to build reusable and flexible routes that can handle a variety of inputs and respond with the appropriate content. Additionally, route parameters can be validated and sanitized to ensure that they conform to specific requirements, such as being a numeric value or a valid email address.

## Postman and Insomnia

Postman and Insomnia are two popular API client tools that allow developers to test, debug, and document APIs. Both tools provide a graphical user interface for sending HTTP requests, viewing responses, and inspecting request and response headers, body, and parameters. Here's a brief overview of each tool:

Postman: Postman is a widely used API client tool that provides a rich set of features for building, testing, and sharing APIs. Postman allows developers to create collections of requests, organize them into folders, and share them with others. It supports authentication, cookies, and various request types, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. Postman also provides a robust testing framework that allows developers to create automated tests to validate API responses.

Insomnia: Insomnia is an open-source API client tool that provides a clean and intuitive user interface for testing and debugging APIs. Insomnia allows developers to create workspaces, organize requests into folders, and share them with others. It supports authentication, cookies, and various request types, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. Insomnia also provides a scripting environment that allows developers to create custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks and customize API requests and responses.

Both Postman and Insomnia are powerful tools for testing and debugging APIs, and they offer similar features and capabilities. The choice between them ultimately depends on personal preference, team requirements, and project constraints.


## Middleware

Middleware in Express.js refers to a set of functions that execute in sequence, in between the processing of the client request and the sending of the server response. These functions can perform various tasks such as modifying the request or response objects, invoking the next middleware function in the sequence, or terminating the request-response cycle.

Middleware functions are added to the request-response cycle using the app.use() method or one of the HTTP method functions (get(), post(), etc.) provided by Express. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are added to the application, and they can be added at the application level or at the router level.

Examples of middleware functions in Express.js include body-parser, which parses the request body and adds it to the request object, and morgan, which logs incoming requests.

Middleware functions can also be used for various purposes, such as authentication, rate-limiting, error handling, and caching. In general, middleware functions can be very useful for implementing cross-cutting concerns or reusable functionality in your application.

## Model View Controller (MVC)

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern used to separate an application's concerns into three distinct components: the model, the view, and the controller. The main goal of MVC is to improve the maintainability, scalability, and reusability of an application's codebase by promoting a separation of concerns.

Here's a brief overview of each component:

Model: The model represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates data storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations, as well as the application's business rules and logic.

View: The view represents the user interface (UI) of the application. It defines how the data is presented to the user and how the user interacts with the application.

Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly. It also contains the application's flow control logic.

By separating the concerns of an application into three distinct components, MVC promotes code modularity, reusability, and testability. Changes made to one component don't affect the other components, making it easier to maintain and scale the application. Additionally, because the model and view are decoupled, different views can be created for the same model, allowing for greater flexibility in UI design.

MVC is used in many popular web frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Django, and ASP.NET MVC, to name a few.

## MVC in Express

Although Express is a minimal and unopinionated web framework for Node.js, it is possible to implement a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in Express by organizing the application's code into three main components: models, views, and controllers.

1. Models: Models represent the data and business logic of the application. In Express, models can be implemented using various database libraries or ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) such as Mongoose, Sequelize, or Knex. The models encapsulate data storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations, as well as the application's business rules and logic.

2. Views: Views represent the user interface (UI) of the application. In Express, views can be implemented using various templating engines such as EJS, Handlebars, or Pug. The views define how the data is presented to the user and how the user interacts with the application.

3. Controllers: Controllers act as intermediaries between the model and the view. They handle user input and update the model and view accordingly. In Express, controllers can be implemented using plain JavaScript functions or class-based controllers.

To implement MVC in Express, the code can be organized into directories that correspond to each component. For example:

```
- app/
  - controllers/
    - userController.js
  - models/
    - userModel.js
  - views/
    - userView.ejs
  - app.js
```

In this example, the `userController.js` file contains the logic for handling user requests, the `userModel.js` file contains the data storage and manipulation logic, and the `userView.ejs` file contains the HTML template for rendering the user interface. The `app.js` file is the main entry point of the application and contains the configuration for the Express application.

By organizing the code in this way, the application becomes more modular and easier to maintain and scale. Changes made to one component don't affect the other components, making it easier to update or replace parts of the application without affecting the overall functionality.

## Express Routers

Express routers are a way to organize the routes of an Express application into smaller, more manageable groups. Routers provide a way to modularize the routes in an application, making it easier to add, remove, or modify routes as needed. Here are some key features of Express routers:

1. Modularization: Routers allow you to organize routes into smaller, more manageable groups. For example, you might have a router for user-related routes and another for product-related routes.

2. Middleware: Routers can use middleware functions to handle common tasks such as authentication or validation. Middleware functions can be added to the router instance and will only apply to the routes in that router.

3. Mounting: Routers can be mounted on a specific path in the main Express application. For example, you might mount a user router on the path "/users" to handle all requests related to users.

4. Nesting: Routers can be nested inside other routers to create a hierarchy of routes. For example, you might have a main router for your application, and then nest other routers inside of it for specific functionality.

Here is an example of using Express routers:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const userRouter = require('./userRouter');
const productRouter = require('./productRouter');

const app = express();

app.use('/users', userRouter);
app.use('/products', productRouter);

// Handle other routes here

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server listening on port 3000'));
```

In this example, we're creating two separate routers: `userRouter` and `productRouter`. We're then mounting these routers on specific paths in the main Express application using `app.use()`. Any routes defined in `userRouter` will be prefixed with `/users`, and any routes defined in `productRouter` will be prefixed with `/products`.

Using routers in this way can help to keep your code organized and maintainable, especially as your application grows in complexity.

## Restful APIs

RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) are a popular architectural style for building web services. RESTful APIs are based on a set of principles that define how client-server communications should be implemented over the web. Here are some key characteristics of RESTful APIs:

1. Client-server architecture: The client and server are separate and independent, each responsible for their own concerns.

2. Stateless: The server does not keep any information about the client between requests. Each request from the client must contain all the necessary information to complete the request.

3. Uniform interface: RESTful APIs have a uniform interface, meaning that requests and responses should be standardized, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources.

4. Resource-based: Resources should be identified in the request URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). Each resource should have a unique URI and be accessed through the standard HTTP methods.

5. Representation-oriented: Resources should be represented in a standard format, such as JSON or XML.

6. Hypermedia-driven: The server should provide hypermedia links in the response, allowing clients to discover and navigate to related resources.

By following these principles, RESTful APIs are designed to be scalable, flexible, and easily maintainable. They can be used to build a wide variety of web services, including social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

Here is an example of a RESTful API request to retrieve a list of users:

```
GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
```

In this example, the request is sent to the server to retrieve a list of users. The URI `/api/users` identifies the resource, and the HTTP method `GET` is used to request the resource. The `Accept` header specifies that the client expects the response to be in JSON format.

The server will then respond with a JSON representation of the resource:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "users": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane.smith@example.com" }
  ]
}
```

In this response, the server sends a JSON representation of the requested resource, which is a list of users.

## Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic operations that can be performed on most data storage systems. These operations represent the fundamental actions that can be taken on data, and are commonly used in database management, web development, and software development.

1. Create: This operation is used to create new data in the system. For example, creating a new user account on a website, or adding a new product to an online store.

2. Read: This operation is used to retrieve data from the system. For example, retrieving a list of all users on a website, or displaying the details of a specific product in an online store.

3. Update: This operation is used to modify existing data in the system. For example, updating the email address associated with a user account on a website, or changing the price of a product in an online store.

4. Delete: This operation is used to remove data from the system. For example, deleting a user account from a website, or removing a product from an online store.

CRUD operations are essential to many types of software applications and web services, and are often used in conjunction with RESTful APIs. By implementing these basic operations, developers can create powerful and flexible systems for managing data and providing valuable services to users.

## Sending Files

Express.js provides a simple and convenient way to send files as responses to HTTP requests using the `res.sendFile()` method. This method sends a file to the client, and automatically sets the appropriate Content-Type header based on the file's extension.

Here's an example of how to use `res.sendFile()` to send a file in response to an HTTP GET request:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/download', (req, res) => {
  const filePath = '/path/to/file.pdf';
  res.sendFile(filePath);
});
```

In this example, when a GET request is made to the `/download` endpoint, the server sends the file located at `/path/to/file.pdf` to the client.

You can also specify additional options for `res.sendFile()`, such as the `root` directory to use for resolving relative file paths, or a `headers` object to set custom headers in the response.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/download', (req, res) => {
  const filePath = '/path/to/file.pdf';
  const options = {
    root: __dirname,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/pdf',
      'Content-Disposition': 'attachment; filename=download.pdf'
    }
  };
  res.sendFile(filePath, options);
});
```

In this example, we've set the `root` option to `__dirname`, which tells Express to resolve the file path relative to the current directory. We've also set custom headers in the response using the `headers` option, which specifies the content type as `application/pdf`, and sets the `Content-Disposition` header to suggest that the file should be downloaded with the filename `download.pdf`.

Using `res.sendFile()` is a simple and effective way to send files as responses in Express.js. By providing the file path and any additional options, you can easily serve files to clients and control how they're displayed or downloaded.

## Serving Websites with Node

Express.js is a popular framework for building web applications with Node.js, and it can be used to serve static websites as well. Here's how you can use Express to serve a basic website:

1. Install Express: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Express using NPM. Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
npm install express --save
```

2. Create the server: Create a new file called `server.js` and add the following code:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This code creates a new Express app, sets the port number to 3000, and tells Express to serve static files from the `public` directory using the `express.static()` middleware. The last line starts the server and logs a message to the console when it's ready.

3. Create the HTML and CSS files: Create a new directory called `public` in the same directory as `server.js`. In this directory, create an `index.html` file and a `style.css` file.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This is a static website served with Express.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
/* style.css */
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  color: #333;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 48px;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 32px;
  background-color: #eee;
}

p {
  font-size: 24px;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 32px;
}
```

4. Start the server: Run the following command in your terminal to start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```

You should see a message in the console indicating that the server is running. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your website.

This is a basic example, but you can use Express to serve more complex websites with dynamic content as well. Express provides a powerful set of tools for routing, middleware, and template rendering that make it easy to build robust web applications.

## Templating Engines

Templating engines in Node.js and Express provide an easy way to generate dynamic HTML content based on data from a server or database. Here are some popular templating engines that can be used with Express:

1. **Pug (formerly Jade)**: Pug is a popular templating engine that uses indentation and whitespace to define the structure of HTML templates. It supports template inheritance, includes, and mixins, making it easy to reuse code and build complex templates.

To use Pug with Express, you first need to install it:
```bash
npm install pug --save
```

Then, set the view engine for your Express app:
```javascript
app.set('view engine', 'pug');
```

You can then create a Pug template in a file with the `.pug` extension, and use it to render HTML with data passed in from a server or database:
```pug
// index.pug
html
  head
    title= title
  body
    h1= message
```

```javascript
// server.js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', { title: 'My Website', message: 'Welcome to my website!' });
});
```

This code defines a route that renders the `index.pug` template with data passed in as an object. The resulting HTML will have a title of "My Website" and a heading that says "Welcome to my website!".

2. **Handlebars**: Handlebars is another popular templating engine that uses curly braces to define placeholders for data. It supports template inheritance and partials, making it easy to reuse code and build complex templates.

To use Handlebars with Express, you first need to install it:
```bash
npm install handlebars --save
```

Then, set the view engine for your Express app:
```javascript
app.set('view engine', 'hbs');
```

You can then create a Handlebars template in a file with the `.hbs` extension, and use it to render HTML with data passed in from a server or database:
```handlebars
<!-- index.hbs -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{title}}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{message}}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// server.js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', { title: 'My Website', message: 'Welcome to my website!' });
});
```

This code defines a route that renders the `index.hbs` template with data passed in as an object. The resulting HTML will have a title of "My Website" and a heading that says "Welcome to my website!".

Templating engines like Pug and Handlebars provide a powerful way to generate dynamic HTML content in Node.js and Express, making it easy to build dynamic web applications with server-side rendering.

## Layouts and Separation of Concerns

In web development, separation of concerns refers to the practice of breaking up a web application into distinct and independent parts, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality. Separating concerns can make an application easier to develop, test, and maintain, and can help prevent bugs and other issues.

One way to achieve separation of concerns in a web application is to use layouts. A layout is a template that defines the structure of a web page, including the header, footer, and other common elements. By using a layout, you can separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to manage and modify.

In Node.js and Express, you can use a variety of layout engines to achieve separation of concerns. Here are two popular options:

1. **Express-Handlebars**: Express-Handlebars is a templating engine that supports layouts, partials, and helpers. It uses a simple syntax that is similar to HTML, making it easy to learn and use.

To use Express-Handlebars in your Express app, you first need to install it:
```bash
npm install express-handlebars --save
```

Then, you can create a layout template in a file with the `.handlebars` extension, and use it to render other views:
```handlebars
<!-- layout.handlebars -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{{title}}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{> header}}
    <main>
      {{{body}}}
    </main>
    {{> footer}}
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, the layout template includes placeholders for the title, header, and footer, as well as a placeholder for the body of the view.

You can then create other views that use the layout, and render them with data passed in from a server or database:
```handlebars
<!-- home.handlebars -->
{{#layout 'layout'}}
  {{#contentFor 'title'}}Home{{/contentFor}}
  {{#contentFor 'header'}}
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  {{/contentFor}}
  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
{{/layout}}
```

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const exphbs  = require('express-handlebars');

const app = express();

app.engine('.handlebars', exphbs());
app.set('view engine', '.handlebars');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('home');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `home.handlebars` view extends the `layout.handlebars` layout, and includes placeholders for the title and header content. The server renders the `home.handlebars` view and passes in data to be inserted into the placeholders in the layout and the view.
